![CloudyLauncher Application](_docs/CloudyLauncher01.png)

Self-updating launcher / patcher application created for the game PROCK using C#. Creates and compares the checksum for local files against the server, downloads any missing or out-of-date files, and launches the newly updated program. Currently specific to the game "PROCK", but can be altered to work with any program.
